# Voxcel COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Assistance

This was a website for the now disbanded Voxcel startup. Voxcel aimed to publicise and monetise a AI (Artificial Intelligence) app that could predict worsening COPD symptoms (AECOPD) enabling early treatment. The early treatment of COPD had the potential to improve the safety and quality of life of those suffering with COPD.
